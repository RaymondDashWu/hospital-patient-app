# Giving Hospital Goers Agency Over their Stay (WIP)

This app is a current work in progress. At the time of writing it is a skeleton app with the bare features included.

The purpose of this app was to give hospital goers agency over their stay. By allowing the hospital goer to easily communicate with staff they don't feel anxiety associated with the burden of their smaller requests. Thoughts like "Do I really need to bother the nurses with my request?" or "Did the nurse forget my request?". On top of that, a system like this keeps a record for staff to follow and allows them to triage patients. At a time when people are at a weak point in their life it's nice being able to summon help.

App idea inspired from my blog post:
